# EvenOdd-Program
This program will face a lot of updates.
Planning to make a gui.
# How it works
I will release pieces of code with the same name 
but with 1.0, 2.0, etc.. on the end.
# How the code works
It lets you enter Even or Odd and then enter a range and see those numbers.
# Note
When i don't release another script in for days, that means i'm
working on alpha for the GUI.
Then, when the GUI base code is built using PygameZero,
i will be releasing updates more frequently for the GUI,
until i do another big edit.
# Contributors
Make sure to have the latest release!
This will be important. The only reasons i'd keep
the older ones is because they are base code and the newer versions are bug
fixes (other than the GUI update!)
